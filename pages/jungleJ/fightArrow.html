      <h1>“Jungle John”, you look right into Jungle John’s eye, 
        “grab something, we are going to fight them.” Jungle John nods at you approvingly, 
        and both of you look around the room for something to grab and see the rubies around the 
        room shining down at you. “Let’s grab those rubies”, Jungle John tells you. You grab a handful of rubies off the
         wall and off the ground and Jungle John does the same. “Let’s go on other sides of the statues”, you yell at Jungle John. 
         Jungle John runs to the other side of the statues and you both start throwing the rubies at the statues. The statues furiously 
         start battling the rubies away, throwing their hands up in the air back and forth. “Look they are distracted!”, you tell Jungle John,
          “Quick! Let’s knock them over!”. At full speed, both you and Jungle John run head first, hands out, into the statues, pushing them as 
          far as you can. The statues start tipping backwards, hands flailing, and eventually hit the floor with a loud thud. You wait for a second… 
          one, two, three… the statues don’t move. “I think we did it Jungle John, we defeated them”, “Yes I think we did” Jungle John responds. 
          Seeing the Jungle Jewel still on the podium, you go up and grab it. “Thank you” Jungle John looks at you, “I couldn’t have done this without you.” The both of you shake hands and head out of the Jungle John, with the bright, shiny, Jungle Jewel in your hands.
