      <h1>After entering the right answer, the door starts to open and you and Jungle John quickly run inside. You both stand for a while to catch 
        your breath and watch as the doors close behind you, leaving the tiger outside and away from you.
         “Well, that is exploring for you!” says Jungle John. You look ahead into the temple and are shocked by two different paths.</h1>
      <br>
      <h1>
        One path leads you down a forest pit with a few loose vines hanging over it for you to swing over.
         The other path leads you down a hallway filled with arrows flying across the hallway. 
      </h1>
      <br>
      <h1>
        “So, which way do you want to go?” Jungle John asks, “remember depending on the way we go, we may or may not get the Jungle Jewel, so choose wisely”
      </h1>
      <h1 id="chooseTheWay">
        Which way do you go?
