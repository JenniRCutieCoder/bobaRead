      <h1>Not wanting to take your chance with the arrows, you start walking toward the forest pit and vines. 
        You grab onto one of the loose hanging vines and give the other to Jungle John. “I’ll 
        go first, watch what I do,” says Jungle John. He takes the vines and starts walking backward, 
        immediately running forward, and jumps over the edge of the forest pit. He starts flying through 
        the forest pit and lands precisely on the other side of the forest pit, successfully making his way across it. 
        “Now it’s your turn,” Jungle John says. 
    </h1>
      <br>
      <h1>
        Holding onto the vine, 
        you attempt to do the same thing as Jungle John. 
        After walking backward, you run forward and jump over 
        the edge of the forest pit. But in mid-air, your hand slips, 
        causing you to start falling down the vine. Realizing you’re slipping, 
        you reach your hand out further and with all your strength try and grab the 
        vine above you. You barely manage to grasp onto the vine by the fingertip as the 
        vine finishes swinging you across the forest pit. You jump right next to Jungle John, who helps you to your feet. 
        “You did a good job!” he tells you. 
      </h1>

      <h1>
        The both of you look down the hallway, 
        spirits high after managing to jump over the forest pit, and see a doorway at the end of the hallway. Both of you walk inside.

      <h1>
        Upon entering, you are hit with a ray of red light. Rubbing your eyes, 
        you see where the light is coming from. You are standing in a room filled with shiny, 
        red, ruby jewels reflecting off of one another. You look to Jungle John who looks at the room 
        in astonishment. “This must be the Ruby Room,” he says, “I have heard only legends and myths about 
        this room but never actually been able to see it in person until now.” “Legend has it that this room 
        was created as a playroom for the wealthy King Jenge’s daughter Sandra” he continues, “after King Jenge 
        had to go to war to protect this Jaguar Jungle and the Tiger Temple from outsiders, his daughter felt lonely 
        and sad without her father, she felt like he didn’t love her.” “Upon hearing this, King Jenge ordered this Ruby 
        Room to be built as a reminder to his daughter that he will always love her and that his love for her is worth more than a thousand rubies.” You stare into this room, admiring not only its story but also its history. As you look around the room, you notice giant, cat-like statues, “What are these?” you ask. “These statues were put in place to make sure nothing leaves this room, nothing is touched or taken,” Jungle John tells you. 
        Continuing to look around the room, you see a box on a podium. Moving closer, you see that this box is filled with rubies and a little note that says this…

        “That’s the Jungle Jewel!” Jungle John yells, pointing to the jewel in the picture. 
        “So we have to find how many rubies are in this box?” You ask him. “Yes, that’s what I’m guessing,” 
        Jungle John tells you. “How so?” you reply. “I would say you need to find the volume of the box”, replies Jungle John, 
        “you can find the volume by multiplying the height of the box by the width and length of the box. 
        The height is how many rubies tall the box is, the width is how many rubies wide the box is, and the length is how many rubies deep the box is.”
