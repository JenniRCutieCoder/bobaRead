    <h1>“Let’s take the arrow path”, You tell Jungle John. Jungle John nods at you. “On the count of 3, we run.” Jungle John says, “1…2…3! Go!” You and Jungle John sprint across the hallway as fast as you can, you watch as arrows fly right across your eyes nearly missing you, and slamming at the wall on the other side of the hallway. “AHHH!” Jungle John looks back and yells at you. You look at him and see a cut right across his face, with blood coming out the side. “Are you okay!?” You yell at him. “Yea, we have to keep going.” You and Jungle John both pick up the pace and reach the end of the hallway. You look over at the cut on Jungle John’s face. You need something to cover the wound. Looking down at your shirt, you realize you can use your sleeve. “Here take this,” You tell Jungle John and rip a sleeve off your shirt. “Thank you,” Jungle John tells you with a smile.

      Both of you move forward. You and Jungle John entered the room at the end of the hallway. The moment you step into the room, you feel something touch your feet. You down and see… sand? “This must be the Golden Room,” Jungle John tells you. “When Queen Pentras married King Jenge, ruler of the Jaguar Jungle, she was forced to move away from her home in the Sphinx Desert, leaving between her parents, friends, and everything she loved at home.” “She used to say she had to give up a love to keep a love.” Jungle John looks around the room in sorrow, letting the story consume him. “King Jenge saw how much his wife missed the desert so he ordered that a room be built similar to a desert for Pentras.” “Pentras loved it so much that King Jenge used to always call it her ‘Golden Room’” Jungle John looks at you, “ Love does wonderful things doesn’t it?” “Yes, it does” You agree with him.

      Admiring the room, you look down and see what looks like a graph on the ground. “What is this?” You ask Jungle John. “Oh that’s a coordinate plane,” He tells you. “Pentras used to like drawing shapes on the ground in her free time to represent the constellations in the sky she used to see as a kid.” “Look there are dots on the ground, what if we label and connect the dots to make a shape? Maybe that will lead us to the next room and help us find the Jungle Jewel!”
