      <h1>Running as fast as you can, you and Jungle John bolt out of the Golden Room, and into the doorway opening. As you pass the doorway, you are blasted with shades of green and the sounds of something all too familiar. You look at Jungle John and he looks at you, panicked faces shared on both your faces. </h1>
      <br>
      <h1>
        You are back in the Jaguar Jungle. 
      </h1>
      <br>
      <h1>
        Both of you start running back to the door you came from, but it’s too late, the door has been closed. “Oh no,” you tell Jungle John, “What should we do?” “I don’t think we can get back into the Tiger Temple,” Jungle John tells you, “It’s ok, we tried our best, all we can do is hope that the bad guys don’t get the Jungle Jewel.” You look at him with sadness in your eyes. “Hey, it’s ok,cheer up! I had a lot of fun exploring with you! I hope you will join me for other adventures to come.” “For sure!” You tell him. He wraps his arm around yours and both of you head off into the Jaguar Jungle, with spirits high and ready for more adventures to come.
