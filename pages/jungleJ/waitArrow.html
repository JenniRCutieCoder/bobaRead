      <h1>“Let’s wait,” You tell Jungle John. “What!?” Jungle John yells back at you, “Aren’t we going to drown in the sand if we wait!?” “Trust me, Jungle John. If we lay in the right position, then we can avoid getting sucked in by the sand. Let’s wait till the sand reaches our knees.” Jungle John nods and both of you wait till the sand reaches your knees, both holding your breath, hoping you are making the right decision. Once the sand reaches your knees, you motion for Jungle John to lie on his back. Both of you are on your backs, you look up as you see the ceiling getting closer and closer to you. As you at the ceiling, you see what looks like an escape door attached. “Jungle John! Look! Let’s go through there.” As soon as you are able to, you reach forward and grab the ceiling door handle and pull it. Both of you head right into the escape door and close it.

        “That was close! But thank goodness it worked!” Jungle John tells you. Both of you start looking ahead to what the room you are now in has stored for you. Both of you see a podium with a green emerald in the middle of it. Jungle John steps in for a closer look, “Hey, look here!”, he points to the emerald. “This is the Green Goddess, King Jenge found this when he was fighting the Szarbcs people during wartime. He decides to bring this emerald home for his wife and it has been a historical memento since then. I can’t believe we found this, legend says that this emerald was destroyed when Queen Pentras died.” “I guess someone must have saved it before it got destroyed.” You reply. “Yes,” Jungle John says, “And we need to protect it now.” “What about the Jungle Jewel?” You ask. “I don’t think we can find it right now,” Jungle John tells you and points around the room, where you see a window that you both can take to get out of the Tiger Temple. “But this jewel is equally as important so don’t worry about the Jungle Jewel.”

      <h1>
        “So we did it!?” You ask. “Yes, we did it!.” Both of you jump up in joy, happy that you were able to accomplish something and save a precious piece of history.
