      <h1>After selecting 420 rubies, the podium starts to shake. The box lowers into the podium and out comes the Jungle Jewel.
         Jungle John goes and grabs the Jungle Jewel, looking at it in wonder and astonishment. 
         “We got it!”, he says “We got the Jungle Jewel!”. Both of you jump up in the excitement, 
         but that excitement is short-lived. As you both turn around to go out of the ruby room, 
         you heard the room shake, and shake even louder. You both turn and to your horror, the statues start to move, 
         their eyes glowing red. “Oh no,” Jungle John says, “We took something out of the ruby room, and they are going to take it back from us.”
         “Either we have to stay and fight them, or run… what should we do?”</h1>
