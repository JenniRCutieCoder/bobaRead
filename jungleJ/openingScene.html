    <h1>“Over here!” You turned around to see a tall, young, blonde boy hiding inside a jungle bush. 
        “Come here quickly!” he says. You run over to the boy and hid in the bush with him. “We need to be careful, 
        this jungle is very dangerous, did you not read the information book I sent you?” You try and recall your memory 
        about an information book and it hits you. Just yesterday, you got a package containing an information book and a plane ticket 
        to the Jaguar Jungle. When you looked at who sent this package, you were shocked to see it was sent by the world-famous explorer 
        Jungle John. Jungle John is loved by thousands for his great exploring skills and for saving hundreds of ancient artifacts from destruction. </h1>
        <div class="imgBox">
      <h1> You snap back to reality and look at the boy and ask, “Jungle John?”. “Yup! That is me” he replies and winks at you. “Thank you for being here, 
        I usually do my explorations solo, 
        but this artifact is really important to me and we need to get it back in one piece.” He pulls out a picture  and shows you it 
    </h1>

  </div>
    <h1>A big, blue, sparking jewel stares back. “This is the Jungle Jewel, 
      it is the last of its kind, so there are many bad people who want to take this jewel for themselves” 
      he puts the picture away, “but we need to get it first, unfortunately, it is locked away in the dangerous, 
      Tiger Temple, and that is where I need your help.” 
      “Where is the Tiger Temple?” you asked. “To the right of us”, he states and slowly starts to get out of the bush and so do you.</h1>
    <h1>But suddenly you hear a noise, you turn to see where the noise was coming from and see this…</h1>

    <h1 id="run">“Run!" Jungle John says.</h1>
    <div class="imgBox1">
    <h1>You run as fast as you can, dodging every bush, branch, and vine in your path. 
      You run until you crash into the side of a sand wall. You look up to see the Tiger Temple looking down at you. </h1>

      <h1>
      Jungle John comes running right behind you. “Open the Temple!” he yells at you, the angry tiger right on your tail.</h1>

<div class="imgBox2"> 
  <h1>
    You try and pull the door to the temple open, but it would not move. 
    You try harder, nothing. You look around for something to open the door, and notice a key pad with numbers, along with a problem.

  Jungle John yells, “You need to answer the problem.” You hear the growl from the angry Tiger get louder. “And fast!”
